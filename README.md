# GAME PROJECT

## Game Project for Founders and Coders:

This project is about realizing a game. This game should:

- Be built only using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript;
- Not use external libraries (e.g. Bootstrap, React, Jekyll themes).
- Be original and engaging (e.g. not made solely using a tutorial, but it can be inspired by existing games);
- Actually work! We need to be able to play it once itâ€™s deployed.

As is one of my son's favorite games, I decided to build a simple game so he could play with it and tell me what he thought about it.. he's 7 so I wanted to keep it simple and easy, just to have fun with him!
